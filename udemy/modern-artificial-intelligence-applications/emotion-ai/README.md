# Objective

We want to be able to take in all images and predict peoples emotions.

We will train 2 ai models:
- detect key points
- detect emotions

combine these 2 models to make inference based on these 2 models

## Task 2: Import data set

## Facial key point detections
We will be able to detect the key facial points and we will be able to infere more about the person.

We will create model based on CNNs

We have grey scale images 96 x 96. Output are x y coordinates for key facial points.
